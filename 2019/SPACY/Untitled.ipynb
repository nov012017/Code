       " Overall, the rooms were a bit small but nice.,\n",
       " Everything was clean, the view was wonderful and it is very well located (the Prudential Center makes shopping and eating easy and the T is nearby for jaunts out and about the city).,\n",
       " Overall, it was a good experience and the staff was quite friendly. ,\n",
       " what a surprise,\n",
       " What a surprise the Sheraton was after reading some of the reviews.,\n",
       " it would appear there is a massive difference in the rooms, the South tower being the best.,\n",
       " Check in was very efficient and the room was lovely, very large with the most comfortable beds ever.,\n",
       " The hotel as stated is in a fantastic location and the Wrentham Village outlet is well worth a visit for bargain shopping ( the bus picks up outside).,\n",
       " The hotel bar is a little pricey ( not helped by the current dollar rate) but is a nice place to relax after a busy day shopping.,\n",
       " There is a number of restaurants close by.,\n",
       " A cab from the airport to the hotel can be cheaper than the shuttles depending what time of the day you go.,\n",
       " If it is not rush hour it is just under $30. ,\n",
       " Good location       ,\n",
       " Boston from 17th Floor of Sheraton Hotel \n",
       " Find an alternative to the Sheraton,\n",
       " We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights.,\n",
       " I felt like we were staying in a motel.,\n",
       " All toiletries apart from sampoo, conditioner and body lotion were not in the room.,\n",
       " Even the robe was not there.,\n",
       " For the price you pay, you do expect a little more.,\n",
       " Cleaning was done at eratic times of the day, ie 3.30pm!,\n",
       " The hotel is very busy with conferences and evening parties so there is alot of people around all the time.,\n",
       " The lobby is like a train station with the people coming through.,\n",
       " We felt that people staying at the Hilton accross the road, used the hotel as a short cut into the shops. ,\n",
       " Barely Tolerable,\n",
       " If it were possible to give one and a half stars, I'd rather give that-- the stay wasn't terrible,\n",
       " but it wasn't okay either.,\n",
       " It was tolerable, and that's about it.,\n",
       " I stayed at the Sheraton in Back Bay from November 21-25 for a business conference.,\n",
       " For a hotel whose primary purpose is to serve business travelers, I was horrified at the lack of complimentary services and the quality of those that that I was charged for.,\n",
       " Wired internet was $9.95 per night and very unreliable-- on the third night of my stay, the automatic prompt for daily payment wouldn't load.,\n",
       " After an hour with no luck, I called the front desk only to learn there is no helpdesk within the hotel,\n",
       " and I was instead patched through to Sprint.,\n",
       " After over 30 minutes on the phone with a rep, I finally had the internet service reactivated, but for me having to go through this hassle was completely unacceptable while away on a business trip.,\n",
       " I had three small packages (8, 10, and 13 lbs) shipped to me at the hotel; on my bill at checkout, there was a business center charge for $53.,\n",
       " I was told by the front desk that there's work involved when guests receive packages and that the hotel charges a fee based on the weights of packages.,\n",
       " I always have packages shipped to me at hotel, and in my numerous, numerous stays at other hotels have NEVER been charged a fee to receive parcels.,\n",
       " Again, this is unacceptable for a hotel that claims it's for business travelers.,\n",
       " As for my room, I had a spectacular view from the 24th floor in the north tower, but that was really where the postives stopped.,\n",
       " My single room (queen bed) was incredibly small.,\n",
       " The desk was positioned at the foot of the bed and it was impossible to push the desk chair back all the way out from under the desk to get in and out because it hit the bed!,\n",
       " There was barely any clearance between the chair and bed even when the chair was pushed all the way under the desk.,\n",
       " The closet doors when opened blocked the bathroom door.,\n",
       " TV channels were limited and four out of five nights the satellite signal went out repeatedly while I was watching.,\n",
       " Valet parking is absurdly expensive at $41 per night.,\n",
       " Overall, the room was liveable but certainly no where near comfortable.,\n",
       " The location is great and can't be argued, but there are other hotels in the area (like the Hilton across the street) which may be better choices.,\n",
       " I would not stay here again. ,\n",
       " Great Stay!       bath products \n",
       " One of the best!,\n",
       " October 5 nights.,\n",
       " Got the Sheraton on Priceline and went with a certain amount of trepidation having seen the variety of reports.,\n",
       " What did we find?A wonderful hotel with wonderful staff, a wonderful breakfast, in a wonderful location.,\n",
       " We loved it!We were warmly greeted by Will on reception with the words I've got a nice suite for you on the 16th floor North Tower overlooking the Charles River.,\n",
       " Oh yes! - I'll believe it when I see,\n",
       " it!.And see it we did, exactly as described.,\n",
       " I've lived in flats smaller than the room.,\n",
       " King size bed in alcove and large chest of drawers, desk and 3 piece suite with coffee table.,\n",
       " Two windows taking up virtually all the exterior wall with a view down to the river and to the Fenway on the left.,\n",
       " Nice size bathroom in good condition.,\n",
       " Even a small room off the main room with a work surface to house just an ice bucket and the coffee machine.,\n",
       " No safe but used the very effecient safety deposit box system in the lobby.,\n",
       " Hotel linked to the Prudential Centre so plenty of shops and eating places.,\n",
       " Also T stop without going outside.,\n",
       " We ate from the buffet breakfast each morning which filled us up until the evening.,\n",
       " Staff friendly and helpful especially Sophia.,\n",
       " We adopted her!Location is great with trolley tour stop right outside.,\n",
       " It could not have been better in anyway at all.,\n",
       " Would stay again at the drop of a hat. ,\n",
       " Too Small for Too Much Money,\n",
       " The pros of this hotel: relatively convenient to Amtrak Train station; very convenient to the Hynes Convention center T, shopping, and eating; the staff was very friendly; free wi-fi and computers in lobby; Starbucks coffee in room and in lobby; pool and exercise room very nice (complete with sauna and locker,\n",
       " rooms)Cons: the rooms are super tiny; our room backed up to an elevator, which was noisy all night, bathrooms are very small as well; our shower had cracked tiles and grout with mold/mildew in it; housekeeping came at random times during the day, so we never knew when they would show up; wired internet is $10/day; pool deck poorly designed and is VERY slippery bordering on a lawsuit waiting to happen.,\n",
       " If you're traveling alone and attending a function at the convention center, I would recommend this place.,\n",
       " But if you've got more than one person in your room, you should look elsewhere.,\n",
       " There were four of us in that tiny space, and it was hard on all of us.,\n",
       " We kept hearing the elevators all night. ,\n",
       " Nice lobby, but overall bad experience,\n",
       " So there are a mixed bag of reviews for this hotel,\n",
       " , I'll add mine based on a stay in Oct 2008.,\n",
       " The hotel is connected to the Hynes Convention Center, you can't beat this for convenience.,\n",
       " That's the single upside of this property.,\n",
       " Now, for problems: old tube TV, turns out it didn't work at all.,\n",
       " Maid went to the bathroom in my room, left soiled T.P in the wastebasket.,\n",
       " Cost is quite high.,\n",
       " Valet parking $46/nite.,\n",
       " Wired internet in the rooms: $9.99, and it's slow.,\n",
       " Carpets throughout the room areas, both inside the room I stayed in, and generally outside in the hallways were in need of replacement or at least significant cleaning.,\n",
       " Room was dingy, old furniture, nicked and chipped up, Workspace for laptop work was stingy - no wrist supports, ethernet cable just barely stretched such that one can recline on the bed and compute.,\n",
       " Room was,\n",
       " quite small - reservation said king, but when I arrived it was a queen bed jammed in this little room.,\n",
       " Bathroom reminded me of high school, same kind of industrial, bowl-less design.,\n",
       " Couple more pluses, actually: staff was pretty decent overall, and whoever does their elevator planning deserves an A+ - in spite of being quite busy, never had to wait for more than 10-15 seconds for an elevator at the lobby level.,\n",
       " Note I've been mostly staying in BB lately, so it had been a while since I've had to stay in a chain hotel.,\n",
       " Never again - no more chain hotels, certainly Sheraton is pushed waaay down on the list now, Motel 6 for them. ,\n",
       " Fantastic choice,\n",
       " This is great hotel for Boston visitors.,\n",
       " Rooms are clean and updated and the staff is very friendly.,\n",
       " The location is unbeatable.,\n",
       " It has a T stop attached to the Prudential Center where the hotel is, as well as two other T stops within a few blocks.,\n",
       " I would highly recommend the Sheraton in Back Bay \n",
       " Tiny tiny tiny6317453979 Booked it for $USD 415/night on the hotel website with an AAA discount.,\n",
       " 2 interior hallways down from the Hynes Convention Centre.,\n",
       " Free wifi on 1st and 2nd floors.,\n",
       " Free access to onsite huge gym with lots of weight machines and treadmills, and massive pool and cozy hot tub.,\n",
       " 7 minute run to Charles River.,\n",
       " Lots of eateries in adjacent area (Newbury Street, Prudential Mall, etc.).,\n",
       " Grocery store (Shaw's) directly across.,\n",
       " Closest T stop (Prudential, Green Line) is within connected mall.,\n",
       " Great view from 25th floor.,\n",
       " Old, dusty and a bit dingy in decor.,\n",
       " Small rooms, especially once crib and fridge placed for our baby.,\n",
       " Ridiculously tiny bathrooms.,\n",
       " Quick elevators.,\n",
       " Uninterested frontdesk staff in response to complaints re: significant delay in arrival of requested crib to room. ,\n",
       " Great location, but inattentive to needs,\n",
       " I attended a conference at the Hynes Convention Ctr, and decided to stay at the Sheraton, which is actually connected to the convention center - just a short walk from the 2nd flr lobby.,\n",
       " Parking was expensive at $41./day, but the surrounding public lots were only a bit cheaper with no in/out priveleges and no valet service.,\n",
       " We had a 7 yr old and a 5 mo. old baby, so we requested for an early check-in.,\n",
       " We were told at the desk that the room was not ready.,\n",
       " The front desk lady did not seem interested in helping, and we were told to just wait.,\n",
       " There were no changing tables in the lobby restrooms, so that was a challenge.,\n",
       " We were disappointed because she wasn't really helpful and didn't offer any consolation or extra concern because we had a little one.,\n",
       " I requested a room in the newly renovated wing, but was told there were none, bec.,\n",
       " the hotel was full.,\n",
       " We were put in a dark , small, old room in the 19th floor.,\n",
       " The beds were ok, but the room was indeed tiny.,\n",
       " Not advisable for a family with a baby.,\n",
       " The bathroom was small, too.,\n",
       " The crib and the fridge we requested arrived eventually.,\n",
       " The doormen, and the bellhops were very nice and helpful.,\n",
       " What really mattered a lot was the convenience of the hotel's proximity to the Hynes Conv.,\n",
       " Ctr. ,\n",
       " Lovely hotel!       ,\n",
       " our super comfy bed! \n",
       " Great location, nice hotel I picked the Sheraton based on the location and availability.,\n",
       " I wasn't expecting the hotel to be that nice,\n",
       " but we were very happy with the service and accomodations as well as the location.,\n",
       " We had a king suite on the 15th floor with a nice view of the city and St Charles River.,\n",
       " We could also see Fenway Park.,\n",
       " I would recommend that you request a room on the 15th floor or higher and facing the St Charles river.,\n",
       " The room was spacious.,\n",
       " The decor was just okay as was the bathroom.,\n",
       " Its probably time for an upgrade to the decor.,\n",
       " We enjoyed the pool, jacuzzi and sauna which weren't crowded at all.,\n",
       " We had breakfast twice in the hotel restaurant.,\n",
       " Both times we had the breakfast buffet, which is a little on the pricey side ($20) but a better deal than ordering a la carte.,\n",
       " Our waitress both times was Sophie who is the sweetest women who gave us bottled water for the road.,\n",
       " Overall, the staff was friendly and helpful.,\n",
       " The location, Copley Place/Back Bay is excellent.,\n",
       " There are many restaurants (recommend Sel De La Terre and Atlantic Fish Co), bars and historical sites in walking distance.,\n",

       " My husband and I ate breakfast at the buffet downstairs, and we paid the whole bill with a 20% tip.,\n",
       " The waiter came to collect the money, and before he even open it, he had the guts to ask us if we gave him any tips!,\n",
       " So, i have to say Sheraton is the worst of all hotels, and it is not a 4 star at all, with staff like this.,\n",
       " I thought 4 star hotel means they are personal and friendly, but this is exactly opposite to what my experience has been.,\n",
       " Please never ever pick this hotel.,\n",
       " The staffs in the rooms are unfriendly, and provide the worst service. ,\n",
       " not as bad as some reviews make it out to be stayed in the sheraton boston on vacation from the 16th sept to the 21st sept.hotel is nicely located for getting around the city with a t stop located at the prudential centre which is attached to the hotel.on arrival we were checked in quickly with no problems by very friendly staff,and given complimentary postcards which reception posted free of charge.,\n",
       " Room was on the 17th floor of the north tower.bathroom was spacious,room a fine size,\n",
       " and we had a great view of cambridge and the massachussetts turnpike and could just see fenway park.,\n",
       " Mostly had breakfast in the prudential centre but had breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning.,\n",
       " Like all hotels it was dear enough but you could stock up as often as you wanted with the breakfast buffet for $20.Better options in the prudential centre or nearby try the pour house on newberry street.,\n",
       " The free internet access in the lobby was often unavailable with sometimes only 1 out of 6 computers working but that was only a small problem.,\n",

       " (this is a great deal, only 1,000 points more than a regular room).After a rocky dropping off of the car (there were no valets around, so we got the attention of the doorman, then had to deal with the irate suddenly appearing valets because we usurped their tip...,\n",
       " ah, it was not pleasant)...,\n",

       " Hors d'oeuvres were great, dessert was great, breakfast was fine (cold Continental)...well worth the 1,000 extra points.,\n",
       " I loved sitting there overlooking the Charles...,\n",
       " the room was nothing special - it DID have the Ralph Lauren decor as promised, but it's an old hotel built in the 70's or whenever,\n",
       " so the rooms aren't HUGE, the bathrooms are SMALL, but the nicely renovated room and the club level were well worth it. ,\n",
       " A hotel designed by accountants This is the second time this year I've stayed at a Sheraton, and the general experience is the same.,\n",
       " The hotel feels as though it was designed by accountants.,\n",
       " There is no attention to the comfort of those of us who stay here, rather the attention is on the photo-ops and the lobby.,\n",
       " Lobby was lovely.,\n",
       " Room was pretty bad.,\n",
       " Bed was large, but the bedding was uncomfortable and scratchy and the pillows, though plentiful, were hard-as-a-rock horrors.,\n",

       " Room allocation is critical it would seem Stayed here 3 nights in mid September whilst at a conference in the adjoining Hynes Convention Center.,\n",
       " The hotel is convenient as it is part of the Prudential Center and thus its a very short inside walk to the convention center.,\n",
       " As a result of this (and because of reading some of the reviews here on Trip Advisor regrading the food) we didn't use any of the hotel facilities as the Prudential Center has everything one needs.,\n",

       " This is borne out reading other reviews.,\n",
       " My room was very small with an uncomfortably small bath room.,\n",
       " The room suffered from significant plumbing noises.,\n",
       " I couldn't decided whether this was something to do with the aircon or it was water rushing through pipes.,\n",

       " I suspect it was the plumbing, or specifically, the flushing.,\n",
       " On the plus side thee bed was very comfortable and everything in the room worked.,\n",
       " The walls in this part of the hotel (North Tower - 20th floor) are thin and it was noisy.,\n",
       " For example could hear next door flicking the light switches.,\n",
       " Others have commented on this.,\n",
       " So, judging on my experience alone, I'd not be impressed.,\n",
       " However, my colleague down the hall had a much bigger room and none of the aforementioned issues!,\n",
       " As a SPG member with a few points to my name I would have expected a better room - a feeling confirmed when it transpired that my colleague and I had inadvertently swapped rooms and I should have been in the bigger one without the plumbing noises.,\n",
       " It does make me wonder however whether the 'noisy small' rooms are allocated to those paying the conference rate or whether it was just luck of the draw.,\n",
       " Internet was $9.95 + $.50,\n",

       " When I got to the desk I was expecting the worst but was greeted with a smile even after he was just chewed out.,\n",
       " The clerk made great small talk and after tipping him a 20 we were upgraded to a beautiful suite on the Club level which had a fantastic view and included access to a continental breakfast and some snacks at night.,\n",

       " Theres a ton of great shopping within walking distance and great restaurants as well, try Haru for excellent sushi!,\n",
       " The concierge staff blew me away with their knowledge of the area and Jerry was more than kind enough to help with any reservations or suggestions.,\n",

       " We used to pop into 'Au bon pain' every morning.,\n",
       " It is also right next door to a cheesecake factory which is just a lush dining experience.,\n",
       " We stayed on the 25th floor and the views were spectacular.,\n",
       " The beds were also really comfortable.,\n",
       " There was only one slight problem.,\n",
       " The walls were very thin so you could hear everything that was going on in your neighbours room, even thier nocturnal activities if you understand what I mean,\n",
       " ... ,\n",
       " No character but overall worth the money,\n",
       " Well positioned hotel (Prudential stop on the subway) - not a lot to recommend it from a character point of view but has excellent facilities - especially the beds that are enormous.,\n",
       " Good service and pool and gym area was a bonus.,\n",

       " so if you want to go for a walk on the paved paths, it's not far.,\n",
       " The only thing that I didn't get is why the hotel doesn't have more signs on it so you can see it when exiting the T station.,\n",
       " No shuttle services to the airport, either, which I also thought was strange. ,\n",
       " Loved it!!,\n",
       " Firstly a great hotel.,\n",
       " The sheraton was in a perfect location for us, pretty central and pretty close to the airport.,\n",

       " Another handy feature used by this hotel is in room check out which was great. ,\n",
       " Very much,\n",
       " Satisfied I should start off by saying I booked this 2 night stay (9/6 to 9/8) through my sister who works for Starwood.,\n",
       " This might have had some impact on the room I was given  my experience.,\n",
       " Check in/out was quick even though we were early for check in by a few hours.,\n",

       " but they will get it to you in about 10 minutes.,\n",

       " Doesn't make much sense to me but we went with the 24 hrs.,\n",
       " We also had some phone charges when the only thing we called was within the hotel.,\n",
       " We probably should have questioned it.,\n",
       " It was a couple of bucks.,\n",

       " It also had 2 double beds and we had booked a king.,\n",
       " After waiting on hold for 10 minutes with the front desk, we finally went back downstairs to complain.,\n",
       " Finally we were given a room on the top floor (29th) of the south tower.,\n",

       " The hotel food, however, was terrible.,\n",
       " Not much better than TV dinners.,\n",
       " Also, they could do better to soundproof their rooms as you can hear everyone coming and going when they open and close their room door--,\n",
       " it is very loud.,\n",
       " A nice benefit of this hotel is that they have about 10 free computers for use in the lobby.,\n",
       " It is very convenient if you need to work or just check email.,\n",
       " Also, the setting is nice.,\n",
       " Would I stay here again?,\n",
       " I would probably stay across the street at the Marriott where I stayed a few months ago -- the rooms there are smaller but there is much better food and much better sound proofing.,\n",

       " My husband and I and three children were disappointed with our stay at the Sheraton Boston last weekend,\n",
       " (July 26th - 27th).For starters, before arriving we called the hotel to request two beds and a rollaway,\n",
       " cot in the room.,\n",
       " The person with whom we spoke was quite rude and stated that since we booked through Priceline, she could not accomodate any of our requests, that we were wasting our time speaking with her and we would have to see what was available when we arrived.,\n",
       " Be forewarned, as mentioned in other revieiws, when we arrived, we were informed that the only option for parking our car was through the hotel's valet for a cost of $41 per night.,\n",
       " At check-in we requested a renovated room, but we were given a room on the 25th floor of the non-renovated tower.,\n",
       " At that time we requested a rollaway,\n",
       " bed/cot.,\n",
       " The 25th floor looks worn (scratched doors, frayed carpet) and our room was horrible,\n",
       " (looked like it was decorated in the '80s) - smelly with a huge stain in the middle of the carpet, stains on the dark blue duvet/comforters, rip in the blue velvet curtains, hairs and mold in the bathroom, dirt inside the drawers and a huge TV that looked about 10 years old which didn't get reception on several channels.,\n",
       " We complained, but were told that since we booked through Priceline, our room could not be changed.,\n",
       " (Regardless of how one books their room, it seems to us that guests should be enititled to clean, pleasant rooms...,\n",
       " )Three hours after we had checked in, we still had not received the rollaway bed.,\n",
       " We called the front desk to follow up, and after another two hours (long after we had hoped to put our youngest child to bed), the bed was delivered without any extra pillows or blankets.,\n",
       " When we requested these items from the guy who delivered them, he told us that these items were not available because they were all really dirty.,\n",
       " Our kids swam in the pool, but the hotel does not employ any lifeguards, so parents have to keep a close eye on their kids.,\n",
       " Due, in part, to the retractable roof, after sundown the pool area is poorly lit, and it's a bit tough to keep track of three kids in the pool without adequate lighting.,\n",
       " To get to the bathroom/locker room from the pool, you have to go through a freezing cold area where the treadmills are located.,\n",
       " The locker room is gross - uncleaned toilet, filthy showers, hair dryers sitting in puddles of water (not very safe).,\n",
       " All of that being said, the location of the hotel is fabulous - in the heart of Boston and attached to the Prudential Center which is an upscale mall with several restaurants and a great food court (which is convenient when you have kids to feed).,\n",

       " The bed was extremely comfortable and the hotel was quiet.,\n",
       " The Sheraton has a great location close to Newbury Street and conveniently attached to the Prudential Center where you can find anything you need!!!,\n",
       " I highly recommend the Duck Tour - it was a wonderful time - and you can purchase the tickets right in the Prudential Center -,\n",
       " just be sure to line up early (outside the Prudential Center) for the tour! ,\n",

       " We stayed here with our daughter, who was participating in the Olympic Trials for the Marathon.,\n",
       " Our rooms were excellent with very comfortable beds .,\n",
       " The day before the trials was our one full day in Boston (first time!), so we were up early (7:00 a.m., which was 4:00 a.m. our time!).,\n",
       " We ate an early breakfast in the Apropos Room.,\n",
       " We did not go for the buffet, as we are light eaters.,\n",
       " I had a fruit bowl, bread basket, and my husband had the eggs with ham.,\n",
       " We also had juice and coffee.,\n",
       " We did not check the price of the juice and coffee, but the other choices seemed reasonable.,\n",
       " Our bill with tip was $55.53!,\n",
       " The charge for coffee and juice was very high!,\n",
       " We later complained to the front desk and were told that they get many complaints about this, but there was nothing they could do.,\n",
       " We could have had two buffet meals which included juice and coffee for $40.00 plus tip.,\n",
       " Avoid the Apropos Room if you are light eaters! \n",
       " select another property I was booked (incorrectly, but that is another story all together),\n",
       " It seems the property and the corporate reservation lines do not communicate.,\n",
       " My first room was a queen $439.00 one night stay.,\n",
       " The queen room was 10 feet by about 14 feet in size.,\n",
       " The room next to mine was being worked on (banging drilling, talking workmen etc.) keep in mind,\n",
       " I booked my trip more than a month ago.,\n",
       " and was given this room even as a strwood member.,\n",
       " I went to the desk to ask (quietly) if there was a king room available.,\n",
       " Without hesitation the guy at the fromt desk gave me a beautiful room over looking the Charels, with a huge king bed for the same price and a much cleaner and larger version of the queen room.,\n",
       " My question is.....,\n",
       " WHY WAS,\n",
       " I TREATED,\n",
       " SO POORLY,\n",
       " BEFORE I COMPLAINED?,\n",
       " There is no reason to give those dirty old queen rooms to people if you have rooms available.,\n",
       " I was in Boston for a business and pleasure visit, but will never stay at this property again.,\n",

       " Better than Last year This is the second time we've stayed at the Sheraton over Patriots Day weekend.,\n",
       " It's a great choice if you're in town for the Boston Marathon, you don't even need to go outside to get to marathon central at the Hines, and all the shopping and dinning you'll need.,\n",
       " (Unless of course you head to the North End for pre-race pasta),\n",
       " Last time we were in a small room with our two boys and could barely walk around the roll away bed.,\n",
       " This time our room was in the part of the hotel closest to the Prudential Center and it was quite spacious.,\n",
       " It had a king size bed and pull out couch.,\n",
       " The kids loved the pool, the adults enjoyed the hot tub.,\n",
       " The fact that they allow you to use the fitness facilities to shower after the marathon is over (well after check out time) is a nice plus.,\n",
       " We ended up arriving quite early in the morning to catch the olympic trials for the womens marathon and had no trouble leaving our car and suitcases.,\n",
       " Once the race was over (still well before check in) we were able to get our room keys and relax in our room.,\n",
       " The front desk staff was very helpful and friendly.,\n",
       " The room was very clean, the bed quite comfortable.,\n",
       " We called for extra blankets and towels and had them delivered within minutes.,\n",
       " I'd like to have had a mini bar/fridge in the room.,\n",
       " The only negative for us was the pompous concierge--the short one on duty in the evening--avoid him and talk to one of the women instead. ,\n",
       " Great Hotel--would stay there again!,\n",
       " Just returned from Boston today, and have to say that the Boston Sheraton was a great place to stay for the Boston Marathon and,\n",
       " for it's location overall.,\n",
       " I had read the prior, mixed reviews, and can tell you I was highly satisfied.,\n",
       " We (my children and I) were on the 27th floor, nice room, nice bathroom.,\n",
       " Everything was clean, and just what you wanted and needed in a room.,\n",
       " The hotel pool and gym facilities were top notch.,\n",
       " Free internet service right by the Starbucks.,\n",
       " Concierge desk was very helpful.,\n",
       " Lots of runners stayed there and there was a cool vibe all weekend.,\n",
       " It was easy to get to the T, shop and eat in the Prudential Center, pick up the race packets from the attached Hynes Convention Center, and to walk around the Back Bay neighborhood. ,\n",
       " typical sheraton stay,\n",
       " It was my second time visiting Boston.,\n",
       " I stayed at this hotel two nights.,\n",
       " in my opinion, the room seemed small in size.,\n",
       " I felt like I was going to hit the nightstand when I would get out of bed.,\n",
       " The room was clean and I had a good view from the 19th floor.,\n",
       " The hotel location was great!,\n",
       " It is near Fenway Park and walking distance to the Shops at Prudential Center.,\n",
       " The T subway station is around the corner from the hotel.,\n",
       " I am planning on returning to Boston in the winter.,\n",
       " This hotel suits my needs.,\n",
       " I would also consider a bit more upscale experience at the Westin or Marriott nearby!? ,\n",
       " Boston Hotel Just returned from a short trip (4 nights) to Boston.,\n",
       " We were delighted with the location of the Sheraton/Boston and its comfortable room, 8th floor north tower.,\n",
       " Being attached to the Prudential shopping mall made it very safe and convenient for me to shop while my husband was otherwise occupied.,\n",
       " Concierge was terrific.,\n",
       " That department simply made our stay the best.............,\n",
       " California travelers \n",
       " Great City Break in Boston,\n",
       " My husband,\n",
       " and I stayed at the Sheraton for one night over the Easter weekend.,\n",
       " When we arrived we had our hire car valet parked, and our luggage was taken into the reception area for us.,\n",
       " Check-in was very quick and efficient, even though we arrived 2 hours before the stated check in time of 3pm.,\n",
       " We were given a room on the 24th Floor of the south tower.,\n",
       " It was a corner room, with full height windows to two sides, giving us a great view across Boston.,\n",
       " The room was very comfortable, and looked to have been recently redecorated.,\n",
       " The bathroom however looked rather tired, and although clean, was in need of refurbishment.,\n",
       " Despite being a fairly upscale Sheraton the room lacked certain features : there was no in room safe, which meant any valuables had to be left in safety deposit boxes at reception; there was no mini bar, or complimentary water, although coffee/tea were provided; there was no shower cap in the bathroom, and only small quantities of shower gel etc.,\n",
       " These are, however, minor issues, and did not impact on our overall enjoyment of the stay.,\n",
       " We were on a room only deal, but there is a Starbucks in the reception area where you can get coffee and muffins if you don't fancy the hotel's full breakfast.,\n",
       " The free internet service in the lobby is a real bonus, allowing us to check in for our return flight with ease.,\n",
       " The hotel links directly into the Prudential centre, a mid-scale shopping centre with a reasonable range of shops and restaurants.,\n",
       " This in turn links to the upscale Copley Plaza shopping centre, definately worth a visit!,\n",
       " Directly opposite the Sheraton (outside the Hilton hotel) is one of the stops for the Boston trolley bus sight seeing tours, and Newbury Street is a short walk from the hotel.,\n",
       " Overall we had a great stay.,\n",
       " The hotel is conveniently located, and accommodation of a good standard.,\n",
       " Would recommend it. ,\n",
       " worst Expeirence in USA,\n",
       " This is my sixth visit to the USA where everytime I stay in different hotel as part of a professional development plan wehre we attend an annual conference.,\n",
       " This time was the worst visit and the hotel played a major role in worsening the experience.,\n",
       " The rooms lack the basic tiny things that we found in other hotels in other states including Sheraton ones as well.,\n",
       " No safe inside the room to keep valuables.,\n",
       " Lighting inside the room is poor and reading was a problem.,\n",
       " Staff were nice but we were not able to get our bills in a way to report accurately to our institutions so they did whatever is suitable for them.,\n",
       " Pets were another problem that initiated allergy for some colleagues.,\n",
       " The breakfast was overpriced like any other hotel, but there was no balanced variety like in other hotels.,\n",
       " Pork is not the favorite breakfast meal for many.,\n",
       " The vending machine was out of order for ten consecutive days and may be more and when we called to complain the operator said try another floor.,\n",
       " This is awkard especially the rooms do not have any mini bar.,\n",
       " The telephones inside the rooms were not efficent.,\n",
       " We were not able to hear the speakers also the fees for a call was expensive even within USA hotels.,\n",
       " The only advantage is that it is related to the Prudential which is a great mall and outing space.,\n",
       " Also its location is great where you can vist some places by walking and easy to get the trolley.,\n",
       " I think some details can imporve the hotel. ,\n",
       " Great for Irish Tourists..do not be put off!!!!,\n",
       " I just got back from the Sheraton,\n",
       " and i had been so scared aout staying there after reading these reviews.,\n",
       " There was no need to be.,\n",
       " A lot of the American reviewers expected a lot...huge rooms etc.,\n",
       " The hotel is fab...you couldnt be in a better location so it is perfect for tourists.,\n",
       " You are attached to the prudential centre through the 2nd floor..great upmarket shops and places to eat (eat in the top of the hub once it is fab).,\n",
       " The t is also in the prudential and the trolley tours leave from right outside the door.,\n",
       " It is a 4 minute walk to newbury street..again great shops and cafes.,\n",
       " It is a 25 dollar cab ride to Logan and about 6dollars to Park Street and we paid 10 dollars to the Galleria (big mall in cambridge)The rooms were absolutely perfect.,\n",
       " If you are used to staying iin hotels like the Radisson..the rooms are of similar quality..,\n",
       " the beds are better tho!,\n",
       " We booked a twin room and got 2 double beds, a huge TV, a big window, a nice desk and chair and a lovely coffee machine in the room.,\n",
       " All in all perfect!The bathrom is a little small but not tiny at all...absolutely fine.,\n",
       " We did stay in the south tower which was important to me after reading the reviews.,\n",
       " From the corridors, it loooks a bit more modern.,\n",
       " The lobby is beatiful, huge with lots of amenities and loads of nice places to sit and have a drink or read.,\n",
       " It has a buzz about it too...always people coming and going.,\n",
       " The staff in the side bar were lovely too, really friendly.,\n",
       " We had breakfast in the hotel one morning for convenience, overpriced but fine.,\n",
       " There is no need to eat there, eat in the mall!!Overall i really have few complaints!I travel a good bit, i have stayed in tiny European hotels and big 4 star hotel suites.,\n",
       " This hotel really was more than i expected.,\n",
       " If you are irish and are trying to imagine it... think of a 4 star Radisson at home and add about 1000 rooms and a much nicer lobby!Its not the luxury of the Fairmont Copley Plaza,\n",
       " but i thought it was perfect.,\n",
       " BTW, i booked on reserve-hotel.com.,\n",
       " Got a rate of 93 euro a nite, an excellent rate!If yook via the hotel, you will pay about 3 times that! ,\n",
       " Nothing Special - A bit dingy Needed to stay in Boston and looked around for a reasonable rate but most of the main hotels that I have used before (Marriott, Westin) were charging around $250-$300 per night.,\n",
       " This property was more reasonable so booked 3 nights via the SPG website chosing a Club room for $199 rather than a Standard at $159-,\n",
       " Big mistake!The Room appeared to offer nothing much more than could be expected from a normal one and I agree with the other reviews here that the rooms are small (particularly the bathroom).,\n",
       " The only difference was the fact that it was on the 26th floor (the top 3 floors are the 'Club Floors'),\n",
       " the corridor of which was very dark and by staying here you got access to their 'Club' on the 29th floor which whilst providing basic breakfast esentials looked tired as was not the sort of place I'd have wanted to have spent a lot of time.,\n",
       " Unlike previous lounges I have been to, it also charged for alcohlic beverages which made me wonder what was the point in paying an extra $40 per night if all I was getting for my money was a higher floor and a basic continental breakfast.,\n",
       " Needless to say the first night I and a colleague went there and were told it was $4 dollars for a beer we left and went to a bar with better decor and atmosphere!The other complaint,\n",
       " I have with the room,\n",
       " is that there was no in room safe,\n",
       " -this is normally always provided in US hotels of this standard - I only keep my passport, travel tickets and some cash in them when they are provided but they are useful and being told by the hotel that they have safe deposit boxes at Reception was not a great solution.,\n",
       " This again left me wondering what I was paying for,\n",
       " couldnt they put safes in the Club floor rooms to give an 'added benefit'?.I used the restaurant once for breakfast and the decor felt very tired and it was, like most hotels, overpriced for breakfast which I sometimes dont mind if it makes you feel like you are getting more for your money in terms of ambience etc.,\n",
       " The hotel is however situated in a good location attached to the Mall with restaurants nearby (I would recommend The Cheesecake Factory and PF Changs in the Mall and if travelling further afield Maggianos, Abe and Louies and Ruth Chris).Staff that I encountered were pleasant and overall the hotel delivered (i.e. a clean and comfortable room),\n",
       " it was just that I thought I would, with the room type I booked, and the fact that I am a Gold SPG holder, got something better.,\n",
       " Compared to the other hotels prices this still offered the best choice, however if you are going to Boston, compare prices and if you can get a deal at say Jury's or the Westin for $20-$30 dollars a night more stay there and leave the Sheraton. ,\n",
       " worst club lounge,\n",
       " Their club lounge is absolutely the worst I have ever been at any hotel and in any country.,\n",
       " The lounge is very small.,\n",
       " There is no staff on site.,\n",
       " I was doing interviews in the lounge when one of the hotel janitors came in and sat down in a massage chair, which is very close to us.,\n",
       " He turned on the massager, closed his eyes, and was really enjoying himself.,\n",
       " I have never seen a hotel staff taking advantage of the hotel amenities while on duty and in front of hotel guests.,\n",
       " I asked him to come back in an hour and he left to vaccum the floor.,\n",
       " It was 11am,\n",
       " and I had to do the rest of my work elsewhere because of the noise.,\n",
       " The hotel location is convenient being adjacent to a mall.,\n",
       " I have stayed there 6 or 7 times in the past few years.,\n",
       " I think I'll still come back to the hotel but,\n",
       " definitely not the club lounge. ,\n",
       " Great Beds,\n",
       " This hotel offers all you would expect from a facility this large, but I never could have anticipate the level of comfort I would experience in their bed.,\n",
       " They really know what they're doing, and from the bed to the bedding, this is the standard to which I compare other accommodations.,\n",
       " Sounds funny, but I suppose sleeping is really what you're there to do.,\n",
       " Great location, decent staff and clean rooms.,\n",
       " The only complaint would be that you can't open the windows in the room, so you're dependent on the thermostat. ,\n",
       " Nice hotel, great location,\n",
       " The Sheraton Boston wasn't in itself anything incredibly special, although it was comfortable.,\n",
       " The rooms are smaller, but you can tell by the area that it's probably no different than other hotels around it.,\n",
       " The ottoman in my room had a questionable stain on it; other than that, the room was very clean.,\n",
       " At $20 for the duration of the stay, the gym was a bit expensive given the quality of equipment.,\n",
       " I didn't use the pool, though, which probably adds a lot of value to the cost.,\n",
       " I went to the bar for dinner, which is right off the lobby.,\n",
       " The service was good, the food tasty.,\n",
       " A big bonus is the mall that's attached to the hotel.,\n",
       " It had everything from fast food to Armani and high-end stores like it.,\n",
       " It gave me something to do at night.,\n",
       " There's also a few great bars within walking distance to the hotel.,\n",
       " The location really can't be beat.,\n",
       " The only complaint I have about my stay regarded room service.,\n",
       " The room next to me got room service one morning, and left the tray outside...,\n",
       " it took the hotel almost 2 full days to pick it up!,\n",
       " It wasn't anything smelly, so it wasn't a big deal, but it showed a lack of attention.,\n",
       " Overall a nice stay. ,\n",
       " I've stayed at better Motel 6's!!,\n",
       " Had a friend in town,\n",
       " so we decided to get a room right in the city.,\n",
       " For the first night I scored a $99 room at the Westin Copley (beautiful!!).,\n",
       " The second night they were sold out, so Priceline gave me the Sheraton for $109.,\n",
       " Both Westin and Sheraton are considered 4 Stars.,\n",
       " What a joke.,\n",
       " Sheraton was disgusting.,\n",
       " Gave us a room in the South Tower #1822.,\n",
       " Hadn't seen a renovation in at least 20 years.,\n",
       " Bathroom was sparse and what you'd expect in a motor lodge in a random town.,\n",
       " Just very disappointing.,\n",
       " South Tower is a bit scary too.,\n",
       " Dingy dark hallways with room service trays sitting around for who knows how long.,\n",
       " We should have asked to change rooms but were told that they were at capacity.,\n",
       " Of course, they know you paid via Priceline,\n",
       " so they just don't care. ,\n",
       " OK for buisness stay,\n",
       " My husband,\n",

       " Check-in was easy.,\n",
       " All of the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful.,\n",
       " Our room was 965 in the south tower.,\n",
       " Upon check-in we were informed that this was the newly rennovated tower.,\n",
       " Our room was a very nice size for a standard room.,\n",
       " Two huge windows.,\n",

       " Lukewarm water, but no hot water.,\n",
       " It was very strange.,\n",
       " I had read that in another review, but blew it off.,\n",
       " Nope, it's true.,\n",
       " Having said that, the service was very good.,\n",
       " When we arrived i called and requested extra pillows, coffee and some bathrobes.,\n",
       " They were at my door within minutes.,\n",
       " I had room service breakfast two mornings.,\n",
       " Very quick, like 15 minutes.,\n",
       " Hot and delicious.,\n",
       " The concierge was very nice and helpful with tips and reservations for dinner.,\n",
       " it was very nice to be able to just walk inside and within minutes be at 2 different shopping centers.,\n",
       " There is also a Cheesecake Factory, PF Changs and Legal Seafood at these centers.,\n",
       " Very convenient.,\n",
       " Legal is ok, the service was horrible.,\n",
       " Atlantic Fish Co. was wonderful and great service, highly reccomend.,\n",
       " This hotel was ok for buisness, but if I were going back for pleasure, I would stay somewhere else. ,\n",
       " Great location.,\n",
       " Crappy hotel.,\n",
       " This hotel is in a great spot for shops and food and sights to see... but the hotel itself leaves a lot lacking, especially for the price tag.,\n",
       " The hotel staff and such are very nice and extremely helpful, it's just the hotel itself.,\n",

       " Dirty and in a terrible location We came to this hotel by bidding on Priceline.,\n",
       " We were looking for an affordable place to stay with kids in Boston.,\n",
