    "The Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset consists of reviews of fine foods from Amazon.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of reviews: 568,454<br>\n",
    "Number of users: 256,059<br>\n",
    "Number of products: 74,258<br>\n",
    "Timespan: Oct 1999 - Oct 2012<br>\n",
    "Number of Attributes/Columns in data: 10 \n",

    "Attribute Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Id\n",
    "2. ProductId - unique identifier for the product\n",
    "3. UserId - unqiue identifier for the user\n",
    "4. ProfileName\n",
    "5. HelpfulnessNumerator - number of users who found the review helpful\n",
    "6. HelpfulnessDenominator - number of users who indicated whether they found the review helpful or not\n",
    "7. Score - rating between 1 and 5\n",

    "9. Summary - brief summary of the review\n",
    "10. Text - text of the review\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "Given a review, determine whether the review is positive (rating of 4 or 5) or negative (rating of 1 or 2).\n",

    "[Q] How to determine if a review is positive or negative?<br>\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "[Ans] We could use Score/Rating. A rating of 4 or 5 can be cosnidered as a positive review. A rating of 1 or 2 can be considered as negative one. A review of rating 3 is considered nuetral and such reviews are ignored from our analysis. This is an approximate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) of a review.\n",
