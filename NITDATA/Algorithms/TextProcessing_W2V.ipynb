    "Given a review, determine whether the review is positive (rating of 4 or 5) or negative (rating of 1 or 2).\n",

    "[Q] How to determine if a review is positive or negative?<br>\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "[Ans] We could use Score/Rating. A rating of 4 or 5 can be cosnidered as a positive review. A rating of 1 or 2 can be considered as negative one. A review of rating 3 is considered nuetral and such reviews are ignored from our analysis. This is an approximate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) of a review.\n",
